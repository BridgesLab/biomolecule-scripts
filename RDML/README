These are sample files for the generation of a RDML file.

The file descriptions are based on http://www.rdml.org/help.php

There are several files that can be combined to make a RDML file:

* quantification.txt
* amplification.txt
* melting_curve.txt
* annotation.txt
* target_annotation.txt
* experimenters.txt
* cycling.txt
