Sweave Files
============

These files are scripts used for analysing particular types of data.  
They are intended to be used generically and I will endeavor to comment them to describe what is going on.  
Currently I am using R version 2.15.1 with totally up to date packages, as of 2012-09-20.

General Use of these Files
``````````````````````````

The general workflow is:

* Set a user specificed working directory containing the Sweave file and the raw data file (normally in csv format).
* Update the script with the particulars of your experiment/analysis
* Run the script to generate PDF files and figures.


Comments and Contributions

These are welcomed and encouraged.  Especially notes about better code flow and statistics for these experiments.  Either comment, or email me.
